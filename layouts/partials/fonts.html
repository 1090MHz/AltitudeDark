  Fonts are imported in the Tailwind CSS file (assets/css/tailwind.css) using @import statements.
  This approach centralizes font management in the CSS file, making it easier to maintain and update.

  Pros of importing fonts in Tailwind CSS:
  - Centralized management: Fonts are defined alongside other styles, reducing duplication.
  - Cleaner HTML: The <head> section is less cluttered, as font imports are handled in CSS.

  Cons of importing fonts in Tailwind CSS:
  - Fonts are loaded later in the page lifecycle, which may cause a Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT).
  - Debugging font-loading issues can be harder, as fonts are not visible in the <head> section.

  If you prefer to preload fonts for better performance and to reduce FOUT, uncomment the <link> tags below
  and remove the @import statements from the Tailwind CSS file.
